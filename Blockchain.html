  <h1>What is Blockchain?</h1>
  <p>Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records transactions in a way that makes them difficult or impossible to alter, hack, or cheat.</p>

  <h2>Key Features of Blockchain</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Decentralization</strong>: No single entity controls the blockchain network.</li>
    <li><strong>Security</strong>: Transactions are secure and tamper-proof.</li>
    <li><strong>Transparency</strong>: All transactions are publicly visible on the blockchain.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How Does Blockchain Work?</h2>
  <p>Blockchain uses cryptographic techniques to create a chain of blocks, each containing a record of transactions. When a new transaction is verified, it is added to the chain, creating a permanent record.</p>

  <h2>Applications of Blockchain</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong>: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology.</li>
    <li><strong>Supply Chain Management</strong>: Blockchain can track the movement of products through the supply chain.</li>
    <li><strong>Voting Systems</strong>: Blockchain can provide secure and transparent voting systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Healthcare</strong>: Blockchain can be used to securely store and share medical records.</li>
  </ul>
